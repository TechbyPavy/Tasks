# Space Debris Simulator

This project is a simple interactive demo built during a hackathon to illustrate the concept of space debris collision detection.  
The goal was not to build a full product, but to demonstrate the idea clearly and visually.

The interface was created with the help of Copilot, using a single-file React setup for fast prototyping.
